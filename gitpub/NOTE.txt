When re-opening this Deliverable to finish the project,
I continously got error codes when running nodemon.

This lead me to coding the rest of the deliverable in a seperate file,
so if the commits arent all up to date when I push this project,
Thats why.

I've attached a photo of the error code from the Terminal.
